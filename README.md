# Python_Text_Summarizer
The code starts by creating a new text object. The code then creates three more text objects and adds them to the first one. Then, it creates two columns for the text objects. Finally, it displays some HTML that will create a container with an overflow-wrap property so that words don't break when they're too long. The code starts by creating a new text object called "st". It then sets up some CSS properties on this object: border: 3px solid rgba(00, 00, 00, 0.90); padding: 5% 5% 5% 10%; border-radius: 10px; overflow-wrap: break-word; This is what makes the div element have rounded corners and be able to wrap around words without breaking them into multiple lines of code in Markdown format (the <style> tag). Next comes the line col1 = st.columns(2) which tells Python how many columns there are in this document before displaying any content in those columns (col1 and col2). Next comes st.markdown("""<style>div[data-testid="metric-container"] {border: 3px solid rgba(00, 00, 00, 0.
The code creates a div with the class "metric-container" and sets its border to be 3px wide, 5% thick, 10px radius. It also adds padding of 5% on all sides. The overflow-wrap property is set to break-word so that text will wrap around the container. The code above has two columns, col1 and col2 which are created by st.columns(2).
